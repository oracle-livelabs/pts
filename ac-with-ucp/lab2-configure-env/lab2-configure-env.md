# Configure the application environment

## Introduction

In this lab, we will customize the environment that will be used to run the rest of the workshop.

> **Note**: Most components should have been pre-created.

There are three main elements in our environment:

* **VCN-DEMORAC** : a **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** has been pre-created with the required network topology components inside the Oracle Cloud (Subnets, Route Tables, Security Lists, Gateways, etc.)
* **dbrac** : a two-node Database Cloud Service (aka Oracle Base RAC Database) **RAC database** with **Grid Infrastructure** (which should have also been pre-created)
* **demotac** : a **Compute instance** Virtual Machine hosting our demo application

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes.


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

<if type="tenancy">
* Complete the network configuration
</if>
<if type="sandbox">
* Review the network configuration
</if>
* Configure RAC database services
* Create a demo schema in the database
* Compile a demo application


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

<if type="tenancy">
* An Oracle Cloud Account (aka tenancy) where you created this environment by following LiveLabs instructions.
</if>
<if type="sandbox">
* An Oracle LiveLabs sandbox environment providing the components described above.
</if>



## Task 1: Configure the Network for Oracle Net

  1. Create a **Network Security Group** rule allowing Oracle Net connectivity

    * It is necessary to **open TCP port 1521** in the VCN to allow the demo application to connect to the database. We can do this by configuring a **Network Security Group Rule** and adding the NSG to the database.

    <if type="sandbox">
    * *As you are running this workshop in a sandbox environment, the configuration of the Virtual Cloud Network, Network Security Group, and the association between the NSG and the database have been completed automatically. For a better understanding of what was done, follow the instructions in this task without actually creating these components. Changing them will result in errors throughout the workshop.*
    </if>

    * From the Oracle Cloud web console, go to **Networking** and select your VCN. It should be named **VCN-DEMORAC**.

      ![OCI console menu vcn](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/networking-vcn.png " ")

        >**Note:** Be sure to select the **region** and **compartment** that have been assigned to you.

        ![Select compartment](./images/task1/select-compartment.png " ")

    * Select the VCN

      ![Select VCN](./images/task1/select-vcn.png " ")

    * Then click on **Network Security Group** under **Resources** to create a Network Security Group in the VCN.

      ![Create NSG](./images/task1/create-nsg.png " ")

    * Enter a name for the Network Security Group

      ````
      Name : <copy>NSG-DEMORAC</copy>
      ````

    * Click **Next**

  2. Then add a **stateful ingress rule** allowing Oracle Net connectivity within the VCN

    * Enter the following values in the **Add Security Rules** dialog:

      Stateless   : leave unchecked

      Direction   : Ingress

      Source Type : Enter the following CIDR block
      ````
      Source CIDR : <copy>10.0.0.0/16</copy>
      ````

      IP Protocol : select TCP

      Source Port Range : leave empty (ie ALL)

      ````
      Destination Port range : <copy>1521</copy>
      ````

      ````
      Description : <copy>Allow Oracle Net connectivity within the VCN</copy>
      ````

      * Example

        ![Create NSG example](./images/task1/create-nsg-example.png " ")

      * Click **Create**


  3. Finally add the NSG to the database

    * From the Oracle Cloud web console, go to **Oracle Database**

      ![OCI console menu database](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/database-basedb.png " ")


    * Select database **dbrac**

      ![Select dbrac database](./images/task1/select-dbrac-database.png " ")

    * Under Network, Click on **Edit**

      ![Add NSG to dbrac](./images/task1/add-nsg-to-dbrac.png " ")

    * select NSG-DEMORAC and **Save**

      ![Select NSG](./images/task1/select-nsg.png " ")


## Task 2: Configure the Network for Oracle Notification Services


  1. Connect to Cloud shell from the details page of database **dbrac**

    * Click on the Cloud Shell icon from the top right of the OCI console

        ![Cloud Shell icon](./images/task2/cloud-shell-icon.png " ")

    * From the Cloud Shell menu, click **Upload**

        ![Cloud Shell window](./images/task2/cloud-shell-window.png " ")

    * Upload the file containing your private key

    * Make sure the mode is set to 400 (**chmod 400 private-key-file**)

        ![Upload Public Key](./images/task2/upload-public-key.png " ")

  2. Check that ONS is running on the server

    * From the database details page, select **Nodes** under **Resources** to find out the public IPs of the database nodes

      ![DB Nodes IPs](./images/task2/db-nodes-ips.png " ")

    * Using Cloud Shell, connect to the first node of the RAC cluster as **opc** and switch to the **oracle** user

      ````
      user@cloudshell:~ $ <copy>ssh -i [private-key-file] opc@[node 1 public IP]</copy>

      (...)
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
      Warning: Permanently added 'xxx' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
      (...)
      ````

    * Switch to user *oracle*

      ````
      $ <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
      ````

    * Check ONS is running on the server

      ````
      [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl status nodeapps</copy>

      VIP 10.0.0.183 is enabled
      VIP 10.0.0.183 is running on node: ruby1
      VIP 10.0.0.80 is enabled
      VIP 10.0.0.80 is running on node: ruby2
      Network is enabled
      Network is running on node: ruby1
      Network is running on node: ruby2
      ONS is enabled
      ONS daemon is running on node: ruby1
      ONS daemon is running on node: ruby2
      ````

    * Also verify the ports used by ONS

      ````
      [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl config nodeapps -s</copy>

      [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ srvctl config nodeapps -s
      ONS exists: Local port 6100, remote port 6200, EM port 2016, Uses SSL true
      ONS is enabled
      ONS is individually enabled on nodes:
      ONS is individually disabled on nodes:
      ````

  3. Add an ingress rule opening TCP port 6200 to FAN events

    * It is necessary to **open TCP port 6200** in the VCN to allow **Fast Application Notification Events** to flow from the cluster database to the client application. We can do this by adding a **Network Security Group Rule** to the database NSG.

    <if type="sandbox">
    * *As you are running this workshop in a sandbox, this network configuration has already been done automatically, but you should still follow the instructions in this step to review and understand what was done without actually creating the rule to open port 6200.*
    </if>

    * From the OCI console under **Networking** > **Virtual Cloud Networks**, select the VCN (**VCN-DEMORAC**)

    * Retrieve the Network Security Group **NSG-DEMORAC** of the database under **Resources** and select it.

    * Click **Add Rules**

    * Enter the following values for another **ingress** rule allowing the propagation of Fast Application Notification (FAN) events to the connection pool

      Stateless   : leave unchecked

      Direction   : Ingress

      Source Type : Enter the following CIDR block
      ````
      Source CIDR : <copy>10.0.0.0/16</copy>
      ````

      IP Protocol : select TCP

      Source Port Range : leave empty (ie ALL)

        ````
        Destination Port range : <copy>6200</copy>
        ````

        ````
        Description : <copy>Allow Fast Application Notification (FAN) events to propagate	</copy>
        ````

    * Example

      ![NSG ingress rule 6200](./images/task2/nsg-ingress-rule.png " ")

    * Click **Add**


## Task 3: Configure RAC Services

  1. Using Cloud Shell, connect to the first node of the RAC cluster as **opc**

    * Using Cloud Shell, connect to the first node of the RAC cluster

        ````
        user@cloudshell:~ $ <copy>ssh -i [private-key-file] opc@[node 1 public IP]</copy>
        ````

    * Switch to user **oracle**

        ````
        $ <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
        ````


  2. Create a database service with standard parameters (no Application Continuity)


    * Find out the database unique name from the details page of the database **CONT** in Oracle Base Database **dbrac**

        Make a note of your Database Unique Name. In should be in the form ***CONT_uvwxyz***.

        ![Find database unique name](./images/task3/find-database-unique-name.png " ")

        *PLEASE NOTE: In the following commands, you need to replace the template database name "cont_prim" by the real value of the database unique name.*

        > **Note:** In most cases one can choose the database unique name when provisioning a database system. However, in our workshop, the value had to be automatically generated and needs to be retrieved.


    * Create the service **demosrv**:

        Cut and paste the following command in an editor and replace **cont_prim** by the real value of your database unique name before executing the command!

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl add service -db cont_prim -service demosrv -preferred CONT1,CONT2 -pdb PDB1 -notification TRUE -drain_timeout 300 -stopoption IMMEDIATE -role PRIMARY</copy>
        ````

    * Check service configuration:

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl config service -db cont_prim -service demosrv</copy>

        Service name: **demosrv**

        Service is enabled
        Preferred instances: CONT1,CONT2
        Available instances:
        CSS critical: no
        ````

        > **Note**: failover type is not set.

    * Start the service and check its status

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl start service -db cont_prim -service demosrv</copy>
        ````

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl status service -db cont_prim -service demosrv</copy>

        Service demosrv is running on instance(s) CONT1,CONT2
        ````

        > **Note**: the service should run on all the preferred instances.


    * If you need to delete the service and create it again, use the following command:

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl remove service -db cont_prim -service demosrv</copy>
        ````

  3. Create a database service with Application Continuity support

    * Create the service **tacsrv**:

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl add service -db cont_prim -service tacsrv -pdb PDB1 -preferred CONT1,CONT2 -failover_restore AUTO -commit_outcome TRUE -failovertype AUTO -replay_init_time 600 -retention 86400 -notification TRUE -drain_timeout 300 -stopoption IMMEDIATE -role PRIMARY</copy>

    * Check service configuration

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl config service -db cont_prim -service tacsrv</copy>

        Service name: **tacsrv**
        Server pool:
        Cardinality: 2
        Service role: PRIMARY
        Management policy: AUTOMATIC
        DTP transaction: false
        AQ HA notifications: true

        Service is enabled
        Preferred instances: CONT1,CONT2
        Available instances:
        CSS critical: no
        ````

        > **Note**: failover type is set to **AUTO**.


    * Start the service and check its status

        ````
        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl start service -db cont_prim -service tacsrv</copy>
        ````

        [oracle@ruby1 ~]$ <copy>srvctl remove service -db cont_prim -service tacsrv</copy>
        ````


## Task 4: Create the Demo Schema


  1. Understand the demo application directory structure


    * Using noVNC, connect to the remote desktop of the client machine **demotac** as user **oracle**.

        ![Remote Desktop](./images/task4/remote-desktop.png " ")

    * The demo application is installed in **/home/oracle/work/ac**

    * The directory structure under **/home/oracle/work/ac** is explained below:

      ![Show Directory Structure](./images/task4/show-directory-structure.png " ")


        ```
        ac           : demo program with its compiling and running scripts
        ac/ddl       : SQL scripts to create the demo schema
        ac/libcli21c : required java libraries
        ac/sql       : SQL scripts to be used in next labs
        ```



  2. Open a terminal window (as oracle) and change directory to $HOME/work/ac/ddl

    ![Access client desktop terminal](./images/task4/client-desktop-terminal.png " ")

    ````
    [oracle@demotac:~]$ <copy>cd $HOME/work/ac/ddl ; ls -al</copy>

    (...)
    -rw-r--r--. 1 oracle oinstall 1047 Jul 29 09:27 ddl10_user.sql
    -rw-r--r--. 1 oracle oinstall 1036 Jul 29 09:27 ddl20_schema.sql
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 oracle oinstall   64 Jun 28 07:50 ddl_setup.sh
    (...)
    ````

  3. Run **ddl_setup.sh** to create the demo schema

    > **Note**: Ignore the error on DROP commands if you are running the script for the first time.

    This script essentially connects to the RAC database and creates a user CONTI in PDB1.

    CONTI will connect to the Pluggable database PDB1 to make accounting entries in table ACCOUNT.

    Each accounting transaction should consist of two lines in ACCOUNT: one with DIR='D' (for Debit) and another one with DIR='C' (for Credit).

    A trigger allows to capture the database service that was used to connect when INSERT statements are executed.


    ````

      8  end biur_account;
      9  /
    Trigger created.
    (...)
    ````

## Task 5: Compile the Demo Application

  1. Understand required **CLASSPATH** libraries

    Our demo program uses JDBC to connect to the RAC database.
    It shows how to create an intelligent connection pool, able to communicate with the cluster database through the Oracle Notification Service.

    To compile and run such a Java program, you need:
    * the right jdbc driver (usually ojdbcX.jar)
    * the right Universal Connection Pool jar file (usually ucp.jar or ucp11.jar)
    * the Oracle Notification Service jar file (usually ons.jar)

    The jar files you need depend on:
    * the version of your Oracle client
    * the version of Java you are using
    * the version of the database you connect to (to a lesser extent)

    **Oracle Database JDBC drivers and Companion Jars** can be downloaded from [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html).

    In our case we are using:
    * JDK 11
    * Oracle 21c instant client
    * Oracle 19c database

    The jar files you need in your **CLASSPATH** have already been downloaded to **/home/oracle/work/ac/libcli21c**


  2. Understand **Universal Connection Pool (UCP)** configuration

    * From the **noVNC** desktop connection as oracle to the client machine, use the text editor to edit the Java program

      ![Access client desktop](./images/task5/access-client-desktop.png " ")

      ![Launch code editor](./images/task5/launch-code-editor.png " ")

      ![Edit Java code](./images/task5/edit-java-code.png " ")


    * The most interesting method is **createPool(String strAlias)** which shows the commands to create a connection pool able to take full advantage of a RAC database.

    * Notice the following elements:

      The call to configure Replay Driver for Application Continuity

        ```
        pds.setConnectionFactoryClassName("oracle.jdbc.replay.OracleDataSourceImpl");
        ```

      The connection URL which should be of the following form to allow FAN auto-configuration

        ```
        String dbURL = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@" +
        	"(DESCRIPTION=" +
        	"(CONNECT_TIMEOUT=90)(RETRY_COUNT=50)(RETRY_DELAY=3)(TRANSPORT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3)" +
        	"(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST="+strScan+")(PORT=1521)))" +			
        	"(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME="+strService+")))";
        ```

      Usual instructions to configure the number of connections in the pool

        ```
        pds.setInitialPoolSize(1);
        pds.setMinPoolSize(1);
        pds.setMaxPoolSize(20);
        ```

      Some additional commands which speak for themselves

        ```
        pds.setFastConnectionFailoverEnabled(true);
        pds.setValidateConnectionOnBorrow(true);
        ```

  3. Update the value of **strScan**

    * Verify the value of strScan and change it in MyCUPDemo.java if necessary.


  4. Compile the demo application

    * Open a terminal window and change to the ac directory:

      ````
      [oracle@demotac:~]$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/work/ac</copy>
      ````

    * Then run the following command to compile the demo application:

      ````
      [oracle@demotac:~/work/ac]$ <copy>MyCompile.sh MyUCPDemo.java</copy>
      ````



**You can proceed to the next lab.**
