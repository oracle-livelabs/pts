    Explicit Semantic Analysis Support for Dense Projection with Embeddings in 
    OML4SQL  
    The unstructured text analytics  algorithm Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is able to 
    output dense projections with embeddings, which are functionally  equivalent to the 
    popular doc2vec (document to vector) representation.  
    Producing  a doc2vec represe ntation is useful as input to other machine learning 
    techniques, for example, classification and regression, to improve their accuracy when 
    used solely with text or in combination with other structured data. Use cases include 
    processing unstructured text f rom call center representative notes on customers or
    customizable, efficient, and engaging map experiences.

    Workspace Manager: Improved Security when using Oracle Workspace Manager  
    Database u sers can have workspace manager objects in their own schema instead of 
    in the WMSYS schema.  
    Oracle Workspace Manager enables collaborative development, what -if analysis from 
    data updates, and maintains a history of changes to the data. Developers can creat e 
    multiple workspaces and group different versions of table row values in different 
    workspaces. With this enhancement, developers have improved security when using 
    this feature. All the workspace manager objects can be stored and invoked in their 
    own user schema in Oracle Autonomous Database and user -managed databases.

    General  
    Enhanced Partitioning Metadata  
    Data dictionary views that contain partitioning -related metadata, for example,  
    ALL_TAB_PARTITIONS , have two additional columns representing the high value 
    (boundary) information of partitions and subpartitions in JSON and CLOB format.  
    Providing the high value (boundary) partitioning information in JSON and as CLOB 
    allows  you to use this information pr ogrammatically. This enables simple and 
    automated processing of this information for schema retrieval or lifecycle 
    management operations.

    Extended Language Support in Oracle Text  
    Language support is extended in Oracle Text, now supporting up to 48 languages. 
    Additionally, there is extended support for all languages. To avoid the e xtended 
    language support increasing your install footprint on disk, a new mechanism is 
    introduced to control the downloaded languages on demand.

    Flashback Time Travel Enhancements  
    Flashback Time Travel can automatically track and archive transactional changes to 
    tables. Flashback Time Travel creates archives of the changes made to the rows of a 
    table and stores the changes in history tables. It  also maintains a history of the 
    evolution of the table's schema. By maintaining the history of the transactional 
    changes to a table and its schema, Flashback Time Travel enables you to perform 
    operations, such as Flashback Query ( AS OF  and VERSIONS ), on t he table to view the 
    history of the changes made during transaction time.  
    Flashback Time Travel helps to meet compliance requirements based on record -stage 
    policies and audit reports by tracking and storing transactional changes to a table, 
    which has also been made more efficient and performant in this release.

    Explicit Semantic Analysis Support for Dense Projection with Embeddings in 
    OML4SQL  
    The unstructured text analytics  algorithm Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is able to 
    output dense projections with embeddings, which are functionally  equivalent to the 
    popular doc2vec (document to vector) representation.  
    Producing  a doc2vec represe ntation is useful as input to other machine learning 
    techniques, for example, classification and regression, to improve their accuracy when 
    used solely with text or in combination with other structured data. Use cases include 
    processing unstructured text f rom call center representative notes on customers or
    customizable, efficient, and engaging map experiences.

    Workspace Manager: Improved Security when using Oracle Workspace Manager  
    Database u sers can have workspace manager objects in their own schema instead of 
    in the WMSYS schema.  
    Oracle Workspace Manager enables collaborative development, what -if analysis from 
    data updates, and maintains a history of changes to the data. Developers can creat e 
    multiple workspaces and group different versions of table row values in different 
    workspaces. With this enhancement, developers have improved security when using 
    this feature. All the workspace manager objects can be stored and invoked in their 
    own user schema in Oracle Autonomous Database and user -managed databases.

    Enhanced Partitioning Metadata  
    Data dictionary views that contain partitioning -related metadata, for example,
    functionality is part of the SQL/JSON standard.  
    Applying JSON path expressions more widely for  querying JSON data boosts 
    your  developer's productivity and simplifies code development.  
    View Documentation  
    SCORE Ancillary Operator for JSON_TEXTCONTAINS()  
    This feature allows you to return a score for your JSON_TEXTCONTAINS()  queries by 
    using the SCORE()  operator.  
    You can also order the results by the score.  
    JSON_TEXTCONTAINS function gains a new parameter for use with the SCORE() 
    function allowing for an improved development experience.

    SODA Enhancements  
    Various extensions are made to the SODA API:  
    • Merge and patch:  New SODA operations mergeOne and mer geOneAndGet.  
    • Embedded Keys:  You can now embed the key of a document in the document 
    itself. This is used for MongoDB -compatible collections.  
    • Dynamic Data Guide:  The operation to compute a data guide on the fly is 
    extended to other SODA languages, besides  PL/SQL and C.

    General  
    Enhanced Partitioning Metadata  
    Data dictionary views that contain partitioning -related metadata, for example,  
    ALL_TAB_PARTITIONS , have two additional columns representing the high value 
    (boundary) information of partitions and subpartitions in JSON and CLOB format.  
    Providing the high value (boundary) partitioning information in JSON and as CLOB 
    allows  you to use this information pr ogrammatically. This enables simple and 
    automated processing of this information for schema retrieval or lifecycle 
    management operations.

    Extended Language Support in Oracle Text  
    Language support is extended in Oracle Text, now supporting up to 48 languages. 
    Additionally, there is extended support for all languages. To avoid the e xtended 
    language support increasing your install footprint on disk, a new mechanism is 
    introduced to control the downloaded languages on demand.

    Flashback Time Travel Enhancements  
    Flashback Time Travel can automatically track and archive transactional changes to 
    tables. Flashback Time Travel creates archives of the changes made to the rows of a 
    table and stores the changes in history tables. It  also maintains a history of the 
    evolution of the table's schema. By maintaining the history of the transactional 
    changes to a table and its schema, Flashback Time Travel enables you to perform 
    operations, such as Flashback Query ( AS OF  and VERSIONS ), on t he table to view the 
    history of the changes made during transaction time.  
    Flashback Time Travel helps to meet compliance requirements based on record -stage 
    policies and audit reports by tracking and storing transactional changes to a table, 
    which has also been made more efficient and performant in this release.
