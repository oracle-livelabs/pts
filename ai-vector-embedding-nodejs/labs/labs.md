# Using Cohere Vector Embedding Models
## Introduction


In this lab we will learn how to use the Oracle OCI generative AI Cohere embedding models with Oracle Vectors. To connect to the generative AI services we will install the oci-common and oci-sdk libraries. For the purpose of this lab these libraries have already been installed on your LiveLab VM.

------------
Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives


In this lab, you will see the following Vector operations using node.js:
* Task 1: Vectorizing a table with Cohere embedding
* Task 2: Perform Similarity Search using Cohere

## Task 1: Vectorizing a table with Cohere embedding

  1. The first step is to vectorize the contents of our table using an embedding model by Cohere. To do this, you will need to create a node.js program to vectorize our phrases using the Oracle OCI generative AI Cohere services.

   The program *vectorizeTableCohere.js* is already on the LiveLab VM. Below are the contents of the file.

      }

      vectorize();
      </copy>
    ```


2. now you are ready to run the *vectorizeTableCohere.js* node.js program. This can be done by performing the following:  


    ```
      <copy>
      node vectorizeTableCohere.js
      </copy>
    ```

    When the program finishes running, you should see something similar to the following:

    ![Lab 1 Task 2 Step 3](images/nodejscohere03.png =60%x*)

  To summarize what we've just done, the *vectorizeTableCohere.js* program connects to the Oracle database, retrieves the text from the INFO column of the MY\_DATA table, and vectorizes the "factoid" for each of the 150 rows. We are then storing the vectorized data as a vector in the column called: V. You will also notice that we used the *embed-english-light-v3.0* embedding model for this operation. In other words an English speaking embedding model, and it's version 3.0 of the light model.
  

  3. Before we move onto performing Similarity Searches using Oracle OCI generative AI Cohere embedding models, we should take a look in the the Oracle database to see the updates made to the *MY\_DATA* table.
  
      3.a. Connect to your Oracle database as the user: **vector** with password: **vector**

      ```
        <copy>
        sqlplus vector/vector@localhost/freepdb1
        </copy>
      ```

    3.b. We can now query the *MY\_DATA* table to verify that all 150 rows have been updated.

    ```
      <copy>
      select count(*) from MY_DATA where V is not null;
      </copy>
    ```


    You should see:

    ![Lab 1 Task 2 Step 4](images/nodejstfr03.png =60%x*)


    3.c. We can also query the vector column: V in the MY\_DATA table to see what the vectors and dimensions look like.

    ```
      <copy>
      select V from MY_DATA;
      </copy>
    ```

    You should see something similar to this-

    ![Lab 1 Task 2 Step 6a](images/nodejscohere05.png =60%x*)


    These numbers encode the semantic representation of the data stored in the corresponding row of the INFO column.
    
    Now lets exit sqlplus with the following command: 
    
    ```
      <copy>
      exit;
      </copy>
    ```

    Now that we have vectorized the data in our table and confirmed the updates, we are ready to move onto the next task which is performing Similarity Searches using our Vectors.


## Task 2: Perform Similarity Search using Cohere


1. In this lab we will see how to perform a similarity search with the Oracle OCI generative AI Cohere embedding models in node.js.

  So far we have vectorized the data in the *MY\_DATA* table using the Oracle OCI generative AI Cohere embedding models, we can now start performing Similarity Searches using the Vectors in our table. Even though the data in our table has been vectorized we will still need to connect to Oracle OCI generative AI Cohere embedding models to vectorize our search phrase with the same embedding model. The search phrase is entered on the fly, vectorized and then used to search against the vectors   in the database. We will create a node.js program to do this.

   The program *similaritysearchCohere.js* is already on the LiveLab VM. Below are the contents of the file.

      runSimilaritySearch();
      </copy>
    ```


2. Save the file and run it with *Node.js* as follows:

    ```
      <copy>
      node similaritySearchCohere.js
      </copy>
    ```

    You should see the following:

    ![Lab 1 Task 3 Step 2](images/nodejscohere06.png =60%x*)

    The first thing you should notice is that the embedding model: "embed-english-light-v3.0" being used in the similarity search matches the embedding model that we used to Vectorize the data in the MY\_DATA table. You will also notice:

    - We are using the reranker with rerank-english-v2.0
    - We are only looking at the TopK 5 - or closest 5 results
    - We are connecting to the OCI generative ai services to use the Cohere embedding models 
    - We are connecting to the Oracle database with the oracledb node.js library



3. For our first example we will enter the word "cars" at the prompt.  

    You should see something similar to:

    ![Lab 1 Task 3 Step 3](images/nodejscohere07.png =60%x*)

    It's possible that your times will be different to ours, as the time includes the network roundtrip REST call. With that being the case, we can see that the first operation is to vectorize our phrase, in this case "cars", and that it took 0.194 seconds.

    - Next we can see that the similarity search took 0.002 seconds (or 2 milliseconds) to locate 5 related entries to the word "cars".

    - The 5 rows returned have the minimum vector distance  to our vectorized phrase cars from our sample data in the MY_DATA table.

    - The vectors with the minimum vector distance tend to have the closest semantic meaning

    - ie the closet vectors tend to be based on the most similar data

    - The results themselves look like a "good" result as all 5 of the factoids are on-point with the phrase "cars".  


4. Next we can type in the word "cats"

    You should see something similar to:

    ![Lab 1 Task 3 Step 4](images/nodejscohere07a.png =60%x*)

    This time, the output does not appear to have the same level of accuracy as "cats and mice" are often used in the same context, there is some correlation between the two animals. But finding a similarity between cats and oranges could be considered a stretch.

    The whole point about Similarity Search is that it is not necessarily exactly correct, it is the best match given the available data using the given embedding model. The embedding model is trained using information available from the internet and other publicly sourced information.

    Perhaps the term "orange" is associated with the color of cats? eg Garfield or Tabby cats. But it would be pure speculation to jump to a conclusion on what drove the embedding model to make this correlation.  

5. We can also try other search phrases for example "fruit", or even "NY".

    You should see something similar to:

    ![Lab 1 Task 3 Step 5](images/nodejscohere08.png =60%x*)

    In both cases the query phrases we enter are not actually in the data set themselves, but the connection or correlation is apparent. It is important to understand that the search is not an exact or substring search for what is in the result set. Instead the results are looking for similar data based on the text being vectorized.
    **or**
    Both of these results were on target and illustrate the power of similarity search. The queries are very different to a traditional relational query where we are looking for an exact match, but in both of these instances neither of the terms "fruit" or "NY" were in our table. Similarity search is able to find a correlation.


6. Next we can search for "Boroughs".

   You should see something similar to:

   ![Lab 1 Task 3 Step 6](images/nodejscohere09.png =60%x*)

    This phrase directs our similarity search to information related to New York City - and you should notice that we do not see "Buffalo" this time. But you may also notice that we see four of the five boroughs: "Bronx" , "Brooklyn", "Manhattan" and "Queens". But we see "Harlem" and not "Staten Island". Harlem is a neighborhood in New York City and not a borough.

    **NOTE: We do have an entry for "Staten Island" in our MY\_DATA table, but once again we can see Similarity Search does not guarantee an exact answer.**


7. For another experiment, we can enter the word "Bombay". should see something similar to this"

   You should see something similar to:


   ![Lab 1 Task 3 Step 7](images/nodejscohere10.png =60%x*)

    The word "Bombay" does not appear in our data set, but the results related to Mumbai are correct because "Bombay" is the former name for "Mumbai", and as such there is a strong correlation between the two names for the same geographic location.

    Remember, similarity search works on the basis of the trained data from which the embedding models use. Trained embedding models use text sourced from the internet and it is very likely that there is information that includes both the names "Bombay" and "Mumbai" in relation to the same place.

8. Now to see what happens when there is no correlation in the terms, let's try something completely random.

    Enter the phrase "random stuff" - you should see:

   ![Lab 1 Task 3 Step 7](images/nodejscohere11.png =60%x*)

    There is little or no correlation between the terms returned and the phrase we entered. This is also likely influenced by the small data-set or number of rows in the MY\_DATA table.

9.  we should take a few moments to understand what the program is doing.

    We are passing the Oracle database Username and Password along with the database connect-string. We then set the number of rows to return (topK) along with whether or not to use  Re-ranking.

   ![Lab 1 Task 4 Step 1b](images/nodejscohere13.png =60%x*)

    The SQL statement returns the text from the INFO column in the MY\_DATA table.

   ![Lab 1 Task 4 Step 1c](images/nodejscohere13b.png =60%x*)

    The SQL statement calls the vector_distance function to perform a similarity comparison of the vectorized value for the input string (:1) with the vector that we stored in column V. This example performs a COSINE Similarity Search. We are only returning the first 5 rows (:2) which can be controlled using the TopK parameter. The key word APPROX informs the Oracle optimizer to use a Vector Index if it is deemed to be beneficial.  

    Below the SQL block we can see the parameter for setting the embedding model to be used by the program:

   ![Lab 1 Task 4 Step 1d](images/nodejscohere16.png =60%x*)

    This is where we can choose the embedding model. we have been using the *embed-english-v3.0* - both to vectorize our data when we populated the MY\_DATA table, as well as when we performed our similarity searches.

## Appendix: Installing OCI generative ai packages on your own machine

1. To install the oci generative ai packages from oracle with *npm* (package installer for node). While logged in as the oracle Linux user, run the following *npm* command:

    ```
      <copy>
      npm install oci-common
      npm install oci-sdk
      </copy>
    ```


## Summary


In this lab you have seen how easy it is to use Cohere with Node.js and Oracle Vectors and Similarity Search.

# Using Transformers.js and Node.js with Oracle AI Vector Search

## Introduction

In this lab we will be using open source embedding models from Hugging Face so they're free to use. In addition to being free to use, these models can be installed locally, so they can be accessed by making a function call to a library, rather than a RESTful call over the internet.

So they're free, local and fast ...plus there are over 500 sentence transformer models to choose from.


*SentenceTransformers.js* is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face’s transformers python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API.  Transformers.js uses ONNX Runtime to run models in Node.js or in a browser.



See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index for more details about Transformers.js


------------
Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:
* Task 1: Vectorizing a table with Sentence Transformers.js embedding
* Task 2: Understanding the Vector Embedding processing
* Task 3: Perform Similarity Search with Sentence Transformers.js
* Task 4: Changing embedding models



## Task 1: Vectorizing a table with Sentence Transformers.js embedding


  1. We're now ready to vectorize our data using Transformers.js. To do this you will need to create a node.js program to vectorize our phrases using the Transformers.js embedding model packages. 

  **NOTE:** We have already installed the Transformers.js library available from hugging face on the LiveLab VM.

  The program *vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js* is already on the LiveLab VM. Below are the contents of the file.

        }
      }

      vectorize();

      </copy>
    ```

2. Save the file and run it with *nodejs18* as follows:


    ```
      <copy>
      node vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js
      </copy>
    ```

    You should see the following:

    ![Lab 3 Task 2 Step 2a](images/nodejstfr02a.png =60%x*)

    Once the program has completed you will see the following:

    ![Lab 3 Task 2 Step 2b](images/nodejstfr02b.png =60%x*)

    If you have previously run this process with Cohere, the first thing you will notice is that this operation runs significantly faster. This can be attributed to the fact that we do not have to go over the internet to perform the task.

    You may have also noticed that we used the *all-MiniLM-L6-v2* embedding model. This is a very popular embedding model with millions of monthly downloads. It's popularity is due to the fact that it tends to be a good trade-off when comparing accuracy and performance.

    To summarize what we've just done, the *vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js* program connects to the Oracle database, retrieves the text from the INFO column of the MY\_DATA table, and vectorizes the data in the INFO column for each of the 150 rows.


3. We can now query the MY\_DATA table in the Oracle database to verify that our data has been updated too:

    3.a. Connect to Oracle database as the user: *vector* and password *vector*

    ```
      <copy>
      sqlplus vector/vector@localhost/freepdb1
      </copy>
    ```


    3.b. We can now query the MY\_DATA table to verify that all 150 rows have been updated.

    ```
      <copy>
      select count(*) from my_data where V is not null ;
      </copy>
    ```

    You should see:

    ![Lab 3 Task 2 Step 3A](images/nodejstfr03.png =60%x*)


    3.c. We can also query the vector column: V in the MY\_DATA table to see what the vectors and dimensions look like.

    ```
      <copy>
      select info from my_data where V is not null ;
      </copy>
    ```


    You should see:

    ![Lab 3 Task 2 Step 3B](images/nodejstfr04.png =60%x*)


    ```
      <copy>
      select V from my_data ;
      </copy>
    ```


    You should see:

    ![Lab 3 Task 2 Step 3C](images/nodejstfr05.png =60%x*)

    Now lets exit sqlplus with the following command: 
    
    ```
      <copy>
      exit;
      </copy>
    ```


## Task 2: Understanding the Vector Embedding processing

  1. Before proceeding any further, lets take a look at the code of the Node.js program we just ran. This will help us understand how this process is being performed. You will notice that this program looks very similar to the other vectorize\_table node.js programs we have run in this workshop, the basic logic flow is very similar for the most part.

   Open the file with your favorite editor. You can use *vi* or *view* to view the contents of the file. We will not be making any changes to the program-

    ```
      <copy>
      vi vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js
      </copy>
    ```



    The first thing you should notice is that the program has just over 100 lines of code. If you've inspected the vectorizing node programs for Cohere you will see that this program logic is very similar. It calls the *oracledb* library to load the Node Oracle driver. This time however we are importing the @xenova/transformers.

    We also have a large number of embedding models to choose from. As we've aready noted, we opted to use the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" embedding model due to it's popularity.       

    ![Lab 3 Task 3 Step 1a](images/nodejstfr06.png =60%x*)

    The next set of code is where we assign the embedding model we have chosen (un-commented line) to use.  

    ![Lab 3 Task 3 Step 1b](images/nodejstfr07.png =60%x*)

    If we scroll a little further down we can see the SQL code that is being called to populate the vectorized data into the MY\_DATA table. The first block of SQL code creates a cursor for the rows we wish to update and the second block performs the update operation.

    ![Lab 3 Task 3 Step 1c](images/nodejstfr08a.png =60%x*)
    ![Lab 3 Task 3 Step 1c](images/nodejstfr08b.png =60%x*)

## Task 3: Perform Similarity Search with Transformers.js

1. The program *similaritySearchHFTransformers.js* is already on the LiveLab VM. Below are the contents of the file.

              console.log('=================');

              for (const hit of docs) {
                console.log(hit);
              }
            } else {
              tic = performance.now();

              // Rerank for better results
              const inputs = tokenizer(texts, { text_pair: docs, padding: true, truncation: true });
              const modelOutput = await model(inputs);
              const scores = modelOutput.logits.data;

              toc = performance.now();

              console.log(`Rerank took ${((toc - tic) / 1000).toFixed(3)} seconds`);

              let idx;
              const unranked = [];
              for (idx = 0; idx < topK; idx ++) {
                unranked.push([scores[idx], docs[idx]]);
              }

              // Sort the unranked list based on the scores in descending order
              const reranked = unranked.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]).reverse();
              console.log('\nReranked results');
              console.log('=================');

              for (idx = 0; idx < topK; idx ++) {
                console.log(reranked[idx][1]);
              }
            }

          } // End of while loop
        } catch (err) {
          console.error(err);
        } finally {

            await connection.close();
        }

      runSimilaritySearch();

      </copy>
    ```

   Now that we've vectorized our data and created the similarity search file, we are ready to try performing a similarity search using the Transformers.js.

2. You can do this by-

    ```
      <copy>
      node similaritySearchHFTransformers.js
      </copy>
    ```

    **NOTE:** The embedding model being used is displayed when we run the program. It is important to make sure that the embedding model you use matches the embedding model you chose when you vectorized the data - in this instance we vectorized our data with *"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"*, and our search is using the same model, so we are good to go. A mismatch will lead to an error and even worse a false positive - in the sense that no error will be displayed but the wrong results will be displayed.

    For our first example let's try the word "cars". This is the same phrase we have tested using the Cohere models, so if you have used those embedding models, you know what to expect, and the results should be similar.

    Enter Phrase: **cars**

    ![Lab 3 Task 4 Step 1b](images/nodejstfr09.png =60%x*)

    In our situation it took about 8 milliseconds to vectorize the query and about 2 milliseconds to perform the query. This is extremely fast when we compare it to the Cohere models as we do not need to perform the roundtrip REST calls over the internet.


3. Next let's try the phrase "cats" and see what is returned.

    Enter phrase: **cats**

    You should see:

    ![Lab 3 Task 4 Step 2](images/nodejstfr10.png =60%x*)

    The first thing you may notice is that the operation runs even faster now as we have already performed our database connection and authorization and the Transformers.js libraries are already loaded into memory too.

    Looking at the query output, not all the results are directly related to our search term: "cats", but one could argue that there is a minor correlation as all 5 rows are animal associations and not fruit. So not bad considering our relatively small number of 150 entries.

4. If we try a more general term like "animals" we should see the following:

    Enter phrase: **animals**

    ![Lab 3 Task 4 Step 3](images/nodejstfr11.png =60%x*)


5. Let's try two queries related to New York...

    First we'll try "NY" and then "boroughs"

    Enter phrase: **NY**

    Enter phrase: **boroughs**

    This time you should see the following:

    ![Lab 3 Task 4 Step 4](images/nodejstfr12.png =60%x*)

    This time we see results that are accurate. For "NY", the model returns the names of places located in the state of "New York". The second search for the term "boroughs" is 100% accurate using the Transformers.js embedding model.

6. Another interesting query to test our results are for the phrase "New Zealand".

    Enter Phrase: **New Zealand**

    This time we see the following:

    ![Lab 3 Task 4 Step 5](images/nodejstfr13.png =60%x*)

    The results we see when using the Transformers.js embedding model have nothing to do with "New Zealand", though they are geographic locations, so one could argue there is a minor correlation here.

## Task 4: Changing embedding models

  1. Just as we have done with the embedding models from other vendors, let's experiment with changing the Sentence Transformer embedding model.

  In this instance we will see what happens when we use a multilingual embedding model. We will switch from *"Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"* to *"Xenova/multilingual-e5-large"*. This embedding model not only supports English, but also other languages including: German, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Thai, etc

  To switch embedding models you will need to comment out the line:
    
    *embedding\_model = *"Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"*

  and uncomment the line:
    
    *embedding\_model = "Xenova/multilingual-e5-large"*.

   To make this switch we will need to change the embedding model in both the programs:

    - *vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js*

    ```
      <copy>
      vi vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js
      </copy>
    ```

    - *similaritySearchHFTransformers.js*

    ```
      <copy>
      vi similaritySearchHFTransformers.js
      </copy>
    ```


    Your programs will look like this **BEFORE** making your modification-

    ![Lab 3 Task 5 Step 1](images/nodejstfr14.png =60%x*)

    Your programs will look like this **AFTER** making your modification-

    ![Lab 3 Task 5 Step 1](images/nodejstfr15.png =60%x*)



2. Before changing to a different embedding model for performing a similarity search you must re-vectorize the contents of the table: MY\_DATA. Do this by running the *vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js* program as follows:


    ```
      <copy>
      node vectorizeTableHFTransformers.js
      </copy>
    ```

    You should see:

    ![Lab 3 Task 5 Step 2](images/nodejstfr16.png =60%x*)

    **NOTE:** Verify that the program is using the new embedding model.

    Since it's the first time we are using this new embedding model there are multiple libraries and modules that will be downloaded and installed into our system. This is done automatically and there should be no manual intervention required, but this will require addition disk space (our system has been sized to accomodate this). Once the embedding model is installed, the data will be vectorized.  


3. We're now ready to try out our new model. As a baseline let's start with the term "cars".  But this time, we'll also perform the similarity search in Spanish "coche", French "voiture" and even a Spanish dialect "carros". What is interesting, is that while the phrases returned are all accurately related to the search phrase "cars", they are not identical phrases returned per language, nor are they in the same sequence.

    ```
      <copy>
      node similaritySearchHFTransformers.js
      </copy>
    ```


    Enter Phrase: **cars**

    Enter Phrase: **coche**

    Enter Phrase: **voiture**

    Enter Phrase: **carros**

    You should see:

    ![Lab 3 Task 5 Step 3](images/nodejstfr17.png =60%x*)


4. So now let's take a look at how the new model fares when we try our phrase "cats" and this time we'll also try German "katze" and Spanish "gato" as well to see what happens...    

    Enter Phrase: **cats**

    Enter Phrase: **katze**

    Enter Phrase: **gato**

    You should see:             

    ![Lab 3 Task 5 Step 4](images/nodejstfr18.png =60%x*)

    Once again the embedding model is fairly accurate for the first two responses for all 3 languages. But after that the results are mixed. In the English version the results are at least within the animals grouping, but the German and Spanish results are a bit more random. Once again underscoring subtle nuances between differnt embedding models.
## Appendix: Installing Xenova Transformers.js on your own machine

1. To install the *Xenova/transformers.js* packages with *npm* (package installer for node). While logged in as the oracle Linux user, run the following *npm* command:

    ```
      <copy>
      npm install @xenova/transformers
      </copy>
    ```
