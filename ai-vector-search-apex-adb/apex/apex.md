# Setup Apex Service

## Introduction

In this lab we will setup an Oracle APEX (Application Express) service with Oracle Autonomous Database for web application development. APEX provides a powerful and user-friendly platform to build scalable, secure, and highly functional web applications. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an APEX service, creating a workspace, and preparing for application deployment.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

## Objectives

By following this guide, you will:

* Set up an Oracle APEX service on your ADB instance.
* Create a new APEX workspace and schema.
* Login to your APEX instance.
* Import and configure a pre-built application in APEX.

### Task 1: Set Up Oracle APEX Service

1. Go to your ADB instance you created.
2. Click on **Database Actions** and select **View All Database Actions**.

7. Click next and install the application and the supporting objects.

## Conclusion

In this lab you created the Oracle APEX service and created a workspace. We imported a pre-built sample RAG application for you to run.  It alsow allows you to quickly leverage existing functionalities and customize them according to your requirements. 

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
