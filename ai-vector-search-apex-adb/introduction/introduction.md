# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The scope of this workshop is to create a Generative AI RAG application using Oracle APEX with AI Vector Search in Oracle Autonomous Database. The workshop uses Oracle Object Storage as the knowledge base repository to store documents.  Customers can use the Oracle Object Storage to securely store confidential business information.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, users will be able to:

* Set up APEX to access the Oracle Object Storage
* Set up Autonomous Database to access the Oracle Object Storage for importing the embedding model
* Import and configure APEX and run the RAG sample application
* Use APEX to call PLSQL for developing applications with Large Language Models [LLMs]
* Use AI Vector Search to store and search vectors in Oracle Autonomous Database
* Access the LLM and generate output

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud Account

## Application Description

In this Oracle Live Labs workshop, participants will develop an advanced APEX application that integrates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model with Oracle's cutting-edge AI and database technologies. Utilizing the ONNX framework and AI Vector capabilities within Oracle Autonomous Database 23AI, this application revolutionizes document management by enabling secure storage, vectorization, and advanced querying of documents stored in Oracle Cloud Object Storage. Users will interact with the application to ask complex questions, receiving precise, context-aware responses based on the vectorized contents of the documents they want to interact with. This workshop provides a deep dive into Oracleâ€™s AI-driven capabilities, equipping participants with the skills to build next-generation applications that merge AI with enterprise data management for enhanced efficiency, security, and insight.
