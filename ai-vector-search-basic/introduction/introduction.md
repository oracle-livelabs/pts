# Introduction

## About this Workshop

**Oracle AI Vector Search** comprises a sophisticated suite of capabilities, empowering developers to seamlessly store, index, and search Vector data within the Oracle Database environment. Vector data, represented as multidimensional arrays of numbers, plays a pivotal role in capturing diverse features within unstructured data, including images, text, audio and video.

Key components of Oracle Vector Database include:

*Vector Data Type*: An innovative data type designed to store vector data directly within the Oracle Database, facilitating seamless integration.

*Vector Indexes*: Specialized indexing mechanisms optimized for rapid and efficient retrieval of similar Vectors, enhancing the database's search efficiency.

*Vector Search SQL Operators*: These novel SQL operators are tailored for conducting intricate similarity searches on Vector data, providing developers with powerful tools to explore and analyze complex datasets.

These new capabilities also support Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a breakthrough generative AI technique that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and private business data to deliver responses to natural language questions. RAG provides higher accuracy and avoids hallucinations by augmenting LLM queries with enterprise data from the customer's Vector database.

Why Use Oracle Database AI Vector Search?
The biggest benefit of Oracle Database AI Vector Search is that semantic search on unstructured data can be combined with relational search on business data in one single system.

This is not only powerful but also significantly more effective because you don't need to add a specialized Vector database, eliminating the pain of data fragmentation between multiple systems.

For example, you use an application that allows you to find a house that is similar to a picture you took of one you like that is located in your preferred area for a certain budget. Finding a good match in this case requires combining a semantic picture search with searches on business data.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Use Vectors in Oracle 23ai Free database.
* Basic query and DML operation on Vectors.
* Use Vector\_distance functions to find the nearest Vector
* Use Attribute filtering to narrow down search results
* Additional functions for using AI Vector Search
