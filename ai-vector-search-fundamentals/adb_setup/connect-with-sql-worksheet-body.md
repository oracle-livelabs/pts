Although you can connect to your Oracle Autonomous Database using desktop tools like Oracle SQL Developer, you can conveniently access the browser-based SQL Worksheet directly from your Autonomous Database console.

1.  If you are not logged in to the Oracle Cloud Console, log in and select **Oracle Database** from the navigation menu and then **Autonomous Database** from the **Overview** column, make sure you are in the right compartment where your ADB is provisioned, and select your database name in the **Display name** column.

2. In your ADB database's details page, click the **Database Actions** button and then choose the **View all database actions** option.

    Logging in from the OCI service console expects that you are the ADMIN user. Log in as ADMIN, or your admin user, if you are not automatically logged in.

3. The Database Actions page opens. In the **Development** box, click **SQL**.

4.  The first time you open SQL Worksheet, a series of pop-up informational boxes may appear, providing you a tour that introduces the main features. If not, click the Tour button (labeled with binoculars symbol) in the upper right corner. Click **Next** to take a tour through the informational boxes.
