# Introduction

RAG is a relatively new artificial intelligence technique that can improve the quality of generative AI by allowing large language models (LLMs) to tap additional data resources without retraining. Implementing RAG requires technologies such as vector databases, which allow for the rapid coding of new data and searches against that data to feed into the LLM. AI Vector Search enables searching both structured and unstructured data by semantics or meaning and values, enabling ultra-sophisticated AI search applications. Native AI vector search capabilities can also help large language models (LLMs) deliver more accurate and contextually relevant results for enterprise use cases using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on your business data.
Oracle Database 23ai leverages the latest AI Vector Search capabilities. Learn how AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai combines semantic search on unstructured data with relational search on traditional business data for faster, more relevant, and more secure results.

## About AI Vector Search

Oracle AI Vector Search brings AI-powered similarity search to your business data without managing and integrating multiple databases or compromising functionality, security, and consistency. AI Vector Search enables searching both structured and unstructured data by semantics or meaning and values, enabling ultra-sophisticated AI search applications. Use the new native VECTOR data type to store vectors directly within tables in Oracle Database 23ai. This is why, for this workshop, you will use an Autonomous Database with Oracle Database 23ai.

## About Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Oracle AI Vector Search capabilities can also help large language models (LLMs) deliver more accurate and contextually relevant results for enterprise use cases using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on your business data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a way to optimize the output of an LLM with targeted, domain-specific information without modifying the underlying LLM model itself. The targeted information can be more up-to-date than what was used to train the LLM and can be specific to a particular topic. That means the Generative AI system can provide more contextually appropriate answers to prompts and base those answers on your current data.
