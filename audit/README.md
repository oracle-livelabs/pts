# Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai custom audit events

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to collect audit information from an Oracle Database instance and use it to build customized charts and reports using Oracle Application Express (APEX). For this example, you will use an Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
This simple example collects audit information from the standard unified audit trail and two custom sources:
- DDL statements and code executed;
- Errors raised in the database instance.
