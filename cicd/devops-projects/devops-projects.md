# Setup Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Project with GitRepo for CI/CD

## Introduction

You will take on the persona of a DevOps Engineer. Your task is to set up an OCI project with a CI/CD pipeline using Git repository integration. This setup will include cloning your Git repository, configuring the OCI Developer Services, and deploying your application to the Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE). The environment will utilize OCI components such as Compartments, Cloud Shell, and the Container Registry for the CI/CD workflow.

Estimated time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

- Set up your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) project environment.
- Clone a Git repository using Cloud Shell for version control.
- Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with OKE.

**Tip:** Keep a notes page to store credentials, API keys, and important information for your CI/CD setup.

### Prerequisites

- Access to an Oracle Cloud Trial or Free Tier Account.
- A Git repository for your project (public or private).
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Git.



## Task 1: Set Up OCI DevOps for CI/CD

### Step 1: Create a DevOps Project

1. In the **Navigation Menu**, go to **Developer Services** and select **DevOps**.
   - Click on **Create devops project**.
   - Provide a meaningful name for your project and description.
   - Select a topic or create a new [Create Topic](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Notification/Tasks/create-topic.htm)
   - Once DevOps Project created open your DevOps Project.
   - Select Logs in **DevOps project resources** Panel then select in Enable Log if currently selected **Not Enabled**

## Task 2: Set Up Cloud Shell and Clone OCI Repository

### Step 1: Launch Cloud Shell

1. Open **Cloud Shell** by clicking the Cloud Shell icon in the top-right corner of the OCI console. This will open a terminal directly in your browser.

### Step 2: Clone and Commit Code to OCI DevOps Project

1. **Download the Code from GitHub in the Cloud Shell terminal**:
   ```bash
   <copy>
   wget https://github.com/ashuashu20691/python-todo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   unzip main.zip
   ```
   - This command will download the code from the public GitHub repository `python-todo`.

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   <copy>
   cd python-todo-main
   ```

3. **Initialize Git** (if not already initialized):
   ```bash
   <copy>
   git init
   ```

4. **Add the OCI DevOps Code Repository as a remote**:
   - You need the OCI DevOps code repository URL (from your DevOps project).
   - Add the OCI remote repository:
   ```bash
   <copy>
   git remote add origin [oci-devops-repo-https-url]
   </copy>
   ```
   - Replace `[oci-devops-repo-https-url]` with the actual URL of your OCI DevOps project repository by selecting the 3 dot menu of your code repository, and select clone repo you will get the https url.

5. **Update DB credentials and Wallet config**.

      1. Update liquibase.properties file in liquibase folder with db credentials
      2. Update config.cfg in the root folder with db credentials
      3. Unzip your DB Wallet zip file and Replace the root Wallet folder.
      4. Navigate to the Wallet folder and update the **sqlnet.ora** file with the following:
         - change DIRECTORY path with DIRECTORY="/app/Wallet"
         ```bash
         <copy>
         WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = file) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY="/app/Wallet")))
         SSL_SERVER_DN_MATCH=yes
         </copy>
         ```
      5. Navigate to the Wallet folder and update the **ojdbc.properties** file with the following:
         - Comment out the oracle.net.wallet_location line.
         - Set javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword to the Wallet password that you entered to download the Wallet.
         - Set javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword to the Wallet password that you entered to download the Wallet.
         ```bash
          <copy>
          #oracle.net.wallet_location=(SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=(DIRECTORY=${TNS_ADMIN})))
         javax.net.ssl.trustStore=${TNS_ADMIN}/truststore.jks
         javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=my_wallet_password
         javax.net.ssl.keyStore=${TNS_ADMIN}/keystore.jks
         javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=my_wallet_password
         </copy>
         ```
6. **Update Docker Image path**.
   1. Open **kubernate.yaml** from the root folder.
   2. Update the image path in image path remember in the next lab keep image name same as **todo-img** while creating container registory.
   ```
   current value: image: bom.ocir.io/oraclepartnersas/todo-img:${BUILDRUN_HASH}

   pattern: region/tenancy/repository-name

   eg. bom.ocir.io/oraclepartnersas/todo-img:${BUILDRUN_HASH}
   ```
   
   ![Marketplace Image](./images/Docker_Push_Build_Pipeline.png)

7. **Commit the code to your OCI DevOps repository**:
   - Stage all the files:
   ```bash
   <copy>
   git add .
   </copy>
   ```
   - Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   <copy>
   git commit -m "Initial commit for Python ToDo project"
   </copy>
   ```
   - Push the code to the OCI DevOps repository:
   ```bash
   <copy>
   git push -u origin master -f
   </copy>
   ```

***Important: Steps to Push Your Code Securely***: 

   - **Repository Authentication Details:**
      - **Username**: Use your Tenancy name/OCI Cloud username. eg.: mytenancy/myusername ie. oraclepartnersas/ashu.kumar@oracle.com
      - **Password**: Use an **Authentication Token** generated from your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.

   - **Generating an Authentication Token**
   
   To push code securely, you must use an authentication token instead of a password:

      - Go to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.
      - Navigate to Profile â†’ Auth Tokens.
      - Click Generate Token and save it securely.
      - Use this token as your password when prompted during Git operations.
