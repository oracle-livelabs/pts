# Introduction

## OCI Project & CI/CD

This workshop provides a step-by-step guide to creating, deploying, and managing projects on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**. You will set up cloud-native resources, create a Kubernetes cluster, configure a CI/CD pipeline, and deploy a sample **Todo App** using OCI services. This lab will also help you gain hands-on experience with Autonomous Database and Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE), applying modern DevOps practices.

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Set up and deploy all project resources on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: compute, networking, and database.
* Create and manage a Kubernetes cluster using Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE).
* Configure and deploy an Autonomous Database with application schemas.
* Build and configure a **Todo App** with a cloud-native approach.
* Use OCI DevOps services to implement a CI/CD pipeline.
* Deploy and manage a Docker-based application with Kubernetes.
* Monitor and access the deployed application through the OKE Load Balancer.

### Prerequisites

This workshop assumes you have:
* Access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
    * A free trial account can be created if needed.
* Access to a laptop or desktop with:
    * Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
    * Tools like Git, Docker, and kubectl.
* Basic understanding of cloud-native concepts, Kubernetes, and Git.
* Previous experience with Docker is beneficial but not required.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
