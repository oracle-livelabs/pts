# Deploy Active Data Guard with ASM

## Introduction
In this lab, you will deploy the ADG. This procedure is basically the same as migrating the database from on-premise to OCI. The Data Guard setup for a Single Instance (SI) or RAC should be the same. In the following steps you will setup data guard from an SI on-premises to an SI in the cloud infrastructure. If you want to setup Data Guard from an SI on-premises to to a 2-Node RAC in cloud infrastructure or RAC on-premises to an SI in the cloud infrastructure please refer to the whitepaper [hybrid-dg-to-oci-5444327](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/availability/hybrid-dg-to-oci-5444327.pdf).

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

-   Manually Delete the standby Database Created by Tooling 
-   Copy the Password File and wallet file to the standby 
-   Configure Static Listeners
-   TNS Entries for Redo Transport
-   Instantiate the Standby Database
-   Clear all online and standby redo logs 
-   Configure Data Guard broker

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the following labs:

- Prepare On Premise Database
- Provision DBCS on OCI (with ASM)
- Setup Connectivity between on-premise and DBCS

**Note: The following steps is for the cloud database using ASM for the storage management in Lab5. If you chose LVM for the storage, please use the other Lab for the LVM.**

## Task 1: Manually Delete the standby Database Created by Tooling 

Please perform the below operations to delete the starter database files in the cloud and we will restore the on-premise database using RMAN. 

To delete the starter database, use the manual method of removing the database files from ASM disk groups. Do not use DBCA as this will also remove the srvctl registration as well as the /etc/oratab entries which should be retained for the standby. 

To manually delete the database on the cloud host, run the steps below.

1. Connect to the DBCS VM which you created in Lab5 with opc user. Use putty tool (Windows) or command line(Mac, linux).

    ```
    ssh -i labkey opc@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    ```

   

2. Switch to the **oracle** user. 

    ```
    <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
    ```

   

3. Get the current `db_unique_name` for the Cloud database. 

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ srvctl config database
    ORCL_nrt1d4
    ```

4. Copy the following scripts, replace the `ORCL_nrt1d4` with the standby `DB_UNIQUE_NAME` which you got in the previous step.

    ```
    <copy>
    set heading off linesize 999 pagesize 0 feedback off trimspool on
    spool /tmp/files.lst
    select 'asmcmd rm '||name from v$datafile union all select 'asmcmd rm '||name from v$tempfile union all select 'asmcmd rm '||member from v$logfile;
    spool off
    create pfile='/tmp/ORCL_nrt1d4.pfile' from spfile;
    exit;
    </copy>
    ```

   

5. Run in sqlplus as sysdba. This will create a script to remove all database files. 

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

    ```

6. change the file mode.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ chmod a+x /tmp/files.lst
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$  
    ```

   
7. Shutdown the database 

   First collect the configuration of the database for future reference, replace the `ORCL_nrt1d4` with the standby `DB_UNIQUE_NAME`.

    ```
    <copy>srvctl config database -d ORCL_nrt1d4 > /tmp/ORCL_nrt1d4.config</copy>
    ```

   Then stop the database: 

    ```
    <copy>srvctl stop database -d ORCL_nrt1d4 -o immediate</copy>
    ```

8. Remove database files 

    Remove the existing data files, log files, and tempfile(s). The password file will be replaced and the spfile will be reused. 

    As **grid** user (sudo from opc user) 

    Edit `/tmp/files.lst` created previously to remove any unneeded lines from sqlplus. Leaving all lines beginning with 'asmcmd'. Then run it.

    ```
    [opc@dbstby ~]$ sudo su - grid
    Last login: Fri Jan 31 08:38:28 UTC 2020
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ vi /tmp/files.lst
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ . /tmp/files.lst
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ exit
    ```

    All files for the starter database have now been removed. 

## Task 2: Copy the Password File to the Cloud Host 

1. Copy the following command, using the on-premise host public ip or hostname.

    ```
    <copy>scp oracle@primary:/u01/app/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/dbs/orapwORCL /tmp</copy>
    ```

   

2. Switch to the **oracle** user, run this command to copy the on-premise database password file to cloud host /tmp directory, chmod 777 to the password file.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ scp oracle@primary:/u01/app/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/dbs/orapwORCL /tmp
    orapwORCL                                                      100% 2048    63.5KB/s   00:00    
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ chmod 777 /tmp/orapwORCL
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ exit
    ```

3. Switch to **grid** user, use asmcmd, replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name, using capital letters in the directory names.

    ```
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ asmcmd
    ASMCMD> pwcopy --dbuniquename ORCL_nrt1d4 -f /tmp/orapwORCL +DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4/orapwORCL_nrt1d4
    copying /tmp/orapwORCL -> +DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4/orapwORCL_nrt1d4
    ASMCMD-9453: failed to register password file as a CRS resource
    ASMCMD>
    ```

    NOTE: if you receive ASMCMD-9453: failed to register password file as a CRS resource then as the **oracle** user execute the following, replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name, using capital letters in the directory names.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ srvctl modify database -db ORCL_nrt1d4 -pwfile '+DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4/orapwORCL_nrt1d4'
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ 
    ```

4. Verify the password file is registered correctly (as **oracle** user),replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.: 

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ srvctl config database -d ORCL_nrt1d4
    Database unique name: ORCL_nrt1d4
    Database name: ORCL
    Oracle home: /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0.0/dbhome_1
    Oracle user: oracle
    Spfile: +DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4/PARAMETERFILE/spfile.269.1031050991

## Task 3: Copying the Wallet File to the Cloud Host 

Make sure that `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora` contains the following line wallet file location is defined as `ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION` parameter in sqlnet.ora 

  From on-premise side.

  ```
  ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION =
    (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE)
      (METHOD_DATA =
        (DIRECTORY = /u01/app/oracle/admin/ORCL/wallet)
      )
    )
  ```

  From cloud side.

  ```
  ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION=(SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=(DIRECTORY=/opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/$ORACLE_UNQNAME)))
  ```

1. Copy the following command, using the on-premise host public ip or hostname.  Change `ORCL_nrt1d4` to the unique name of your standby db.

    ```
    <copy>scp oracle@primary:/u01/app/oracle/admin/ORCL/wallet/ewallet.p12 /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/ORCL_nrt1d4
    scp oracle@primary:/u01/app/oracle/admin/ORCL/wallet/cwallet.sso /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/ORCL_nrt1d4
    chmod 600 /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/ORCL_nrt1d4/*wallet*
    </copy>
    ```

   

2. From cloud side as **oracle** user, run the command to copy the wallet files from on-premise host, use the on-premise host public ip or hostname, change mode to 600.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ scp oracle@primary:/u01/app/oracle/admin/ORCL/wallet/ewallet.p12 /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/ORCL_nrt1d4
    ewallet.p12                                                                                       100% 5467   153.2KB/s   00:00    
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ scp oracle@primary:/u01/app/oracle/admin/ORCL/wallet/cwallet.sso /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/ORCL_nrt1d4
    cwallet.sso                                                                                       100% 5512   147.4KB/s   00:00    
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ chmod 600 /opt/oracle/dcs/commonstore/wallets/tde/ORCL_nrt1d4/*wallet*
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$
    ```



## Task 4: Configure Static Listeners 

A static listener is needed for initial instantiation of a standby database. The static listener enables remote connection to an instance while the database is down in order to start a given instance. See MOS 1387859.1 for additional details.  A static listener for Data Guard Broker is optional. 

1. From on-premise side

  Switch to the **oracle** user, edit listener.ora

    ```
    <copy>vi $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora</copy>
    ```

  Add following lines into listener.ora

    ```
    <copy>
    SID_LIST_LISTENER=
      (SID_LIST=
        (SID_DESC=
        (GLOBAL_DBNAME=ORCL)
        (ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1)
        (SID_NAME=ORCL)
        )
        (SID_DESC=
        (GLOBAL_DBNAME=ORCL_DGMGRL)
        (ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1)
        (SID_NAME=ORCL)
        )
      )
    </copy>
    ```

  Reload the listener.

    ```
    [oracle@workshop ~]$ lsnrctl reload

2. From cloud side

  Switch to the **grid** user, edit listener.ora

    ```
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ vi $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora
    ```

  Add following lines into listener.ora, replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.

    ```
    SID_LIST_LISTENER=
      (SID_LIST=
        (SID_DESC=
        (GLOBAL_DBNAME=ORCL_nrt1d4)

        (SID_NAME=ORCL)
        )
      )
    ```

  Reload the listener.

    ```
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ $ORACLE_HOME/bin/lsnrctl reload

    Connecting to (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=IPC)(KEY=LISTENER)))
    The command completed successfully
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ 
    ```

  Start the Standby database in mount state, replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.

    ```
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ srvctl start database -db ORCL_nrt1d4 -startoption mount
    [grid@dbstby ~]$ 
    ```



## Task 5: TNS Entries for Redo Transport 

1. From on-premise side, switch as **oracle** user, edit the tnsnames.ora

    ```
    <copy>vi $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora</copy>
    ```

    Add following lines into tnsnames.ora, using the public ip or hostname of the cloud hosts, replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.

    ```
    <copy>
    ORCL_nrt1d4 =
      (DESCRIPTION =
      (SDU=65536)
      (RECV_BUF_SIZE=134217728)
      (SEND_BUF_SIZE=134217728)
      (ADDRESS_LIST =
        (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = dbstby)(PORT = 1521))
      )
        (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVER = DEDICATED)
          (SERVICE_NAME = ORCL_nrt1d4)
          (UR=A)
        )
      )
    </copy>
    ```

2. From cloud side, switch as **oracle** user, edit the tnsnames.ora

    ```
    <copy>vi $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora</copy>
    ```

  In the `ORCL_NRT1D4`(Standby db unique name) description, delete the domain name of the SERVICE_NAME. Add the ORCL description, using the public ip or hostname of the on-premise hosts.  It's looks like the following.  Replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.

  **Note:** The different database domain name will get an error when doing the DML Redirection

    ```
    # tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0.0/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
    # Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

    ORCL_NRT1D4 =
      (DESCRIPTION =
        (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = dbstby)(PORT = 1521))
        (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVER = DEDICATED)
          (SERVICE_NAME = ORCL_nrt1d4)
        )
      )

    LISTENER_ORCL =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = dbstby)(PORT = 1521))
      
    ORCL =
      (DESCRIPTION =
      (SDU=65536)
      (RECV_BUF_SIZE=134217728)
      (SEND_BUF_SIZE=134217728)
      (ADDRESS_LIST =
        (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = primary)(PORT = 1521))
      )
        (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVER = DEDICATED)
          (SERVICE_NAME = ORCL)
          (UR=A)
        )
      )
    ```

3. Set TCP socket size, adjust all socket size maximums to 128MB or 134217728. This is only needed to set in the on-premise side, the cloud side has already been set by default.

  From on-premise side, switch to **opc** user.

    ```
    <copy>sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf</copy>
    ```

  Search and modify following entry to the values, save and exit.

    ```
    <copy>
    net.core.rmem_max = 134217728 
    net.core.wmem_max = 134217728
    </copy>
    ```

  Reload and check the values.

    ```
    [opc@primary ~]$ sudo /sbin/sysctl -p
    fs.file-max = 6815744
    kernel.sem = 250 32000 100 128
    kernel.shmmni = 4096
    kernel.shmall = 1073741824
    kernel.shmmax = 4398046511104
    kernel.panic_on_oops = 1
    net.core.rmem_default = 262144
    net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
    net.core.wmem_default = 262144
    net.core.wmem_max = 134217728
    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 2
    net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 2
    fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576
    net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 9000 65500
    [opc@primary ~]$ sudo /sbin/sysctl -a | egrep net.core.[w,r]mem_max
    net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
    net.core.wmem_max = 134217728

    sysctl: reading key "net.ipv6.conf.lo.stable_secret"
    [opc@adgstudent1 ~]$ 
    ```



## Task 6: Instantiate the Standby Database 

The standby database can be created from the active primary database.

1. From cloud side, switch to **grid** user, create pdb directory in ASM, Replace `ORCL_NRT1D4` with your standby db unique name using capital letters. If the directory exist, ignore the error.

    ```
    grid@dbstby ~]$ asmcmd
    ASMCMD> mkdir DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4/pdbseed
    ASMCMD> mkdir DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4/orclpdb
    ASMCMD> mkdir RECO/ORCL_NRT1D4/ONLINELOG
    ASMCMD> exit
    ```

2. Copy the following command, Replace `ORCL_NRT14D` with your standby db unique name using capital letters.

    ```
    <copy>
    ALTER SYSTEM SET db_file_name_convert='/u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL','+DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4' scope=spfile;
    ALTER SYSTEM SET set db_create_online_log_dest_1='+RECO' scope=spfile;
    ALTER SYSTEM SET log_file_name_convert='/u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL','+RECO/ORCL_NRT1D4/ONLINELOG' scope=spfile;
    ALTER SYSTEM SET db_domain='' scope=spfile;
    exit;
    </copy>
    ```

   

3. Switch to **oracle** user from the cloud side, Run the command in sqlplus as sysdba. This will modify the db and log file name convert parameter, unset `db_domain`. 

    **Note:** The different database domain name of the on-premise and cloud will cause DML Redirection error, in this lab, we don't use the database domain.

    ```
    SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET db_file_name_convert='/u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL','+DATA/ORCL_NRT1D4' scope=spfile;

    System altered.

    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ 
    ```



## Task 7: Clear All Online and Standby Redo Logs 

1. From cloud side, connect database as sysdba.

    ```
    [oracle@dbstby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

    SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Fri Jan 31 12:55:44 2020

    Oracle Database 19c EE Extreme Perf Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
    Version 19.10.0.0.0

    SQL> 
    ```

2. Copy the following command.

    ```
    <copy>
    set pagesize 0 feedback off linesize 120 trimspool on
    spool /tmp/clearlogs.sql
    select distinct 'alter database clear logfile group '||group#||';' from v$logfile;
    spool off
    @/tmp/clearlogs.sql
    </copy>
    ```

   

3. Run the command, this will clear or create new online and standby redo log, ignore the unknown command.

    ```
    SQL> set pagesize 0 feedback off linesize 120 trimspool on
    SQL> spool /tmp/clearlogs.sql
    SQL> select distinct 'alter database clear logfile group '||group#||';' from v$logfile;
    alter database clear logfile group 1;
    alter database clear logfile group 2;
    alter database clear logfile group 3;
    alter database clear logfile group 4;
    alter database clear logfile group 5;
    alter database clear logfile group 6;
    alter database clear logfile group 7;

    ```



## Task 8: Configure Data Guard Broker

1. Copy the following command.

    ```
    <copy>
    show parameter dg_broker_config_file;
    show parameter dg_broker_start;
    alter system set dg_broker_start=true;
    select pname from v$process where pname like 'DMON%';
    </copy>
    ```

   

2. Run the command on primary and standby database in sqlplus as sysdba to enable the data guard broker.

  From on-premise side,

    ```
    SQL> show parameter dg_broker_config_file;

    NAME				     TYPE	 VALUE
    ------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
    dg_broker_config_file1		     string	 /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0
                /dbhome_1/dbs/dr1ORCL.dat
    dg_broker_config_file2		     string	 /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0
                /dbhome_1/dbs/dr2ORCL.dat
    SQL> show parameter dg_broker_start

    NAME				     TYPE	 VALUE
    ------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
    dg_broker_start 		     boolean	 FALSE
    SQL> alter system set dg_broker_start=true;

    System altered.

    SQL> select pname from v$process where pname like 'DMON%';

    PNAME
    -----
    DMON

    SQL> 
    ```

  From cloud side

    ```
    SQL> show parameter dg_broker_config_file

    NAME				     TYPE	 VALUE
    ------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
    dg_broker_config_file1		     string	 /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0
                .0/dbhome_1/dbs/dr1ORCL_nrt1d4
                .dat
    dg_broker_config_file2		     string	 /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0
                .0/dbhome_1/dbs/dr2ORCL_nrt1d4
                .dat
    SQL> show parameter dg_broker_start

    NAME				     TYPE	 VALUE
    ------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
    dg_broker_start 		     boolean	 FALSE
    SQL> alter system set dg_broker_start=true;

    System altered.

    SQL> select pname from v$process where pname like 'DMON%';

    PNAME
    -----
    DMON

    SQL> 
    ```

2. Register the database via DGMGRL. Replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.

    ```
    [oracle@standby ~]$ dgmgrl sys/Ora_DB4U@ORCL
    DGMGRL for Linux: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Sat Feb 1 03:51:49 2020
    Version 19.10.0.0.0

    Welcome to DGMGRL, type "help" for information.
    Connected to "ORCL"
    Connected as SYSDBA.
    DGMGRL> CREATE CONFIGURATION adgconfig AS PRIMARY DATABASE IS ORCL CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS ORCL;
    Configuration "adgconfig" created with primary database "orcl"
    DGMGRL> ADD DATABASE ORCL_nrt1d4 AS CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS ORCL_nrt1d4 MAINTAINED AS PHYSICAL;
    Database "orcl_nrt1d4" added
    DGMGRL> enable configuration;
    Enabled.
    DGMGRL> SHOW CONFIGURATION;

    Configuration - adgconfig

      Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
      Members:
      orcl        - Primary database
        orcl_nrt1d4 - Physical standby database 

    Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled

    Configuration Status:
    SUCCESS   (status updated 42 seconds ago)
    ```

  if there is a warning message, Warning: ORA-16809: multiple warnings detected for the member or Warning: ORA-16854: apply lag could not be determined. You can wait serveral minutes and show configuration again.

  Now, the Hybrid Data Guard is ready. The standby database is in mount status.

You may proceed to the next lab.
