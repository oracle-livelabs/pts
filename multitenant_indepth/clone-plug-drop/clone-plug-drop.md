# Clone, Plug and Drop

## Introduction
Oracle Multitenant enables an Oracle Database to function as a container database (CDB). A CDB consolidates multiple pluggable databases (PDB), a portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and non-schema objects. Whether deployed on-premises or in the cloud, with Oracle Multitenant, applications run unchanged in self-contained PDBs, improving resource utilization, management, and overall security.

*Estimated Workshop Time*: 2 hour

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Explore rapid cloning and provisioning
* Explore local clones and remote clones
* Save database administrators time by provisioning pluggable databases as clones locally or from across the network without disrupting the source
* Explore refreshable PDBs
* Maintain up-to-date copies of production databases by periodically topping them up with incremental transactions.


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
* SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
* You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys (*Free Tier* and *Paid Tenancies* only)
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free Tier* and *Paid Tenancies* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup


## Task 1: Initialize Environment
Proceed as indicated below to Initialize your workshop instance prior to executing any subsequent step or lab.

Refer to *Lab Environment Setup* for the detailed instructions relevant to your SSH client type (e.g. Putty on Windows or Native such as terminal on Mac OS):
  - Authentication OS User - “*opc*”
  - Authentication method - *SSH RSA Key*

1. First login as “*opc*” using your SSH Private Key

2.  Download and execute pre-labs init scripts.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd /tmp/
    wget https://c4u02.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/tfC_fKB7HB5Wo1pvpYu1fHifVw-E7MZruSx9l5J6ebjhGZOwsFawUiJlJhzgR7Hy/n/c4u02/b/hosted_workshops/o/stacks/db-multitenant-prelab-init.zip
    unzip db-multitenant-prelab-init.zip -d bootstrap
    cd bootstrap; chmod +x *.sh
    sudo ./db19-prelab-init.sh
    </copy>
    ```

3.  Sudo to “*oracle*” user, start the listeners and restart the two container databases.

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    cd /tmp/bootstrap
    lsnrctl start LISTCDB1
    lsnrctl start LISTCDB2
    ./stop_all.sh

    <copy>connect soe/soe@localhost:1524/oe_dev</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>select count(*) from sale_orders;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step7.6-checkrecordsoedev.png " ")

7. Connect as **SOE** to **OE** and check the number of records in the **sale_orders** table.

    ```
    <copy>connect soe/soe@localhost:1523/oe</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>select count(*) from sale_orders;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step7.7-checkrecordsoe.png " ")

8. Close and remove the **OE_DEV** pluggable database.

    ```
    <copy>connect sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter pluggable database oe_dev close;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>drop pluggable database oe_dev including datafiles;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step7.8-closeoedev.png " ")

9. Leave the **OE** pluggable database open with the load running against it for the rest of the steps in this lab.

You can see that the clone of the pluggable database worked without having to stop the load on the source database. In the next step, you will look at how to refresh a clone.

## Task 9: PDB Refresh
This section looks at how to hot clone a pluggable database, open it for read only and then refresh the database.

[](youtube:L9l7v6dH-e8)

The tasks you will accomplish in this step are:
- Leverage the **OE** pluggable database from the previous step with the load still running against it.
- Create a hot clone **OE_REFRESH**` in the container database **CDB2** from the pluggable database **OE**
- Refresh the **OE_REFRESH**` pluggable database.

1. Start SQLPLUS if you aren't already in a SQLPLUS session.

    ```
    <copy>sqlplus /nolog </copy>
    ```
1. Connect to the container **CDB2**.
    ```
    <copy>connect sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba</copy>
    ```

2. Create a pluggable database **OE\_REFRESH** with manual refresh mode from the database link **oe@cdb1\_link**.

    ```
    <copy>create pluggable database oe_refresh from oe@cdb1_link refresh mode manual;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter pluggable database oe_refresh open read only;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step8.2-createoerefresh.png " ")

3. Connect as **SOE** to the pluggable database **OE\_REFRESH** and count the number of records in the **sale\_orders** table.

    ```
    <copy>conn soe/soe@localhost:1524/oe_refresh</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>select count(*) from sale_orders;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step8.3-connectassoe.png " ")

4. Close the pluggable database **OE_REFRESH** and refresh it from the **OE** pluggable database.

    ```
    <copy>conn sys/oracle@localhost:1524/oe_refresh as sysdba</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter pluggable database oe_refresh close;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter session set container=oe_refresh;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter pluggable database oe_refresh refresh;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter pluggable database oe_refresh open read only;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step8.4-closeoerefresh.png " ")

5. Connect as **SOE** to the pluggable database **OE\_REFRESH** and count the number of records in the **sale\_orders** table. You should see the number of records change.

    ```
    <copy>conn soe/soe@localhost:1524/oe_refresh</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>select count(*) from sale_orders;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step8.5-countrecords.png " ")

6. Close and remove the **OE_DEV** pluggable database.

    ```
    <copy>conn sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter pluggable database oe_refresh close;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>drop pluggable database oe_refresh including datafiles;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step8.6-removeoedev.png " ")

7. Leave the **OE** pluggable database open with the load running against it for the rest of this lab.

## Task 10: PDB Relocation

This section looks at how to relocate a pluggable database from one container database to another. One important note, either both container databases need to be using the same listener in order for sessions to keep connecting or local and remote listeners need to be setup correctly. For this lab we will change **CDB2** to use the same listener as **CDB1**.

The tasks you will accomplish in this step are:
- Change **CDB2** to use the same listener as **CDB1**
- Relocate the pluggable database **OE** from **CDB1** to **CDB2** with the load still running
- Once **OE** is open the load should continue working.

1. Start SQLPLUS if you aren't already in a SQLPLUS session.

    ```
    <copy>sqlplus /nolog </copy>
    ```
1. Connect to the container **CDB2**.
    ```
    <copy>conn sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter system set local_listener='LISTCDB1' scope=both;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step9.1-changelistener.png " ")

2. Connect to **CDB2** and relocate **OE** using the database link **oe@cdb1_link**.

    ```
    <copy>conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb2 as sysdba;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>create pluggable database oe from oe@cdb1_link relocate availability max;
    alter pluggable database oe open;
    show pdbs</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step9.2-relocateoe.png " ")

3. Connect to **CDB1** and see what pluggable databases exist there.

    ```
    <copy>conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb1 as sysdba</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>show pdbs</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step9.3-showcdb1pdbs.png " ")

4. Close and remove the **OE** pluggable database.

    ```
    <copy>conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb2 as sysdba</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter pluggable database oe close;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>drop pluggable database oe including datafiles;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step9.4-removeoepdb.png " ")

5. The load program isn't needed anymore and that window can be closed.

6. If you are going to continue to use this environment you will need to change **CDB2** back to use **LISTCDB2**.

    ```
    <copy>sqlplus /nolog</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb2 as sysdba;</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>alter system set local_listener='LISTCDB2' scope=both;</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step9.6-changetolistcdb2.png " ")

## Lab Cleanup

1. Exit from the SQL command prompt and reset the container databases back to their original ports. If any errors about dropping databases appear they can be ignored.

    ```
    <copy>exit</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>./resetCDB.sh</copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/step10-labcleanup1.png " ")

    ![](./images/step10-labcleanup2.png " ")

Now you've had a chance to try out the Multitenant option. You were able to create, clone, plug and unplug a pluggable database. You were then able to accomplish some advanced tasks that you could leverage when maintaining a large multitenant environment.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
