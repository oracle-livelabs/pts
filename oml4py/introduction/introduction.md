# Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py)

## About this Workshop

This workshop introduces you to Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) on Oracle Database. OML4Py supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, invocation of in-database algorithms for model building and scoring, and embedded execution of user-defined Python functions from Python or REST APIs. OML4Py also includes the AutoML interface for automated algorithms and feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Join us for this tour of OML4Py.

Python is a major programming language used for data science and machine learning. OML4Py is a feature on Oracle Database that provides Python users access to powerful in-database functionality supporting data scientists for both scalability, performance, and ease of solution deployment.  

Estimated Time:  2 hours 50 min

### **About Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py)**

Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) is a component of Oracle Database, that includes Oracle on premise, Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD).  You can run Python functions on data for data exploration and preparation while leveraging Oracle Database as a high-performance computing environment. Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks is available through Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD) services.
