# Deploy disaster recovery

## Introduction

In this lab you will learn how to use the cloud console to manage Oracle Data Guard associations in your DB System. An Oracle Data Guard implementation includes two DB systems, one containing the primary database and one containing the standby database. When you enable Oracle Data Guard for a virtual machine DB system database, a new DB system with the standby database is created and associated with the primary database.

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* Deploy a Data Guard standby database for disaster recovery
* Test DR strategy by performing a switchover operation
* Enable Fast-Start Failover
* Change Data Guard protection mode configuration
* Pause and resume redo apply on standby
* Test Fast-Start Failover with Maximum Availability configuration

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Provisioned Oracle Base Database Service Enterprise Edition - Extreme Performance
* Both DB Systems must be in the same compartment.
* The DB Systems must be the same shape type.
* The database versions and editions must be identical.

## Task 1: Enable Data Guard

Please take a moment to watch the video below to learn how to perform the Database Lifecycle Task using the OCI Console, and then afterwards, follow the steps shown.

[Enable Data Guard for a VM DB System] (youtube:8zyIMjJoRF8)

1. On Oracle cloud console, click on main menu **≡**, then **Oracle Base Database** under Oracle Database. Click **WS-DB** DB System.

2. Add to your notes the Availability Domain you see on the DB System Information page (e.g. IWcS:EU-FRANKFURT-1-AD-1).

3. On the DB System Details page, click the database name link **WSDB** in the bottom table called Databases.

4. Observe Data Guard - Status: Not enabled, on the Database Information page.

5. Click **Data Guard Associations** in the lower left menu. Click **Enable Data Guard**. Provide the following details:

    - Display name: **WS-DBStb**
    - Availability domain: AD2 (different from your DB System AD)
    - Select a shape: **VM.Standard.E4.Flex** with 1 core OCPU, 16 GB memory
    - Virtual cloud network: LLXXXXX-VCN
    - Client Subnet: **LLXXXXX-SUBNET-PUBLIC Public Subnet**
    - Hostname prefix: **db-hoststb**
    - Data Guard Type: **Active Data Guard**
    - Protection mode: **Maximum Performance**
    - Password: Use the strong password written down in your notes.

6. Click **Enable Data Guard**.

7. Click **≡**, then **Oracle Base Database** under Oracle Database. Or use the breadcrumbs link **DB Systems**. Click **WS-DBStb** DB System. Status is Provisioning...

8. If you want to see more details, click **Work Requests** in the lower left menu. Check Operation Create Data Guard having status In Progress... Wait until your Standby DB System is Available. On **WS-DBStb** DB System details page, click **Nodes** in the lower left menu, and and copy Public IP Address and Private IP Address in your notes.

9. Check **Data Guard Associations** in the lower left menu to see all details about your disaster-recovery configuration. Also check the **Database Role** field on the Database Details page under General information.


## Task 2: Connect to Standby DB System

1. Connect to the WS-DBStb standby DB System node using SSH (Use Putty on Windows).

    ````
    <copy>
    ssh -C -i Downloads/ssh-key-XXXX-XX-XX.key opc@<Standby Node Public IP Address>
    </copy>
    ````

2. All Oracle software components are installed with **oracle** OS user. Use the substitute user command to start a session as **oracle** user.

    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    </copy>
    ````

3. The Data Guard command-line interface (DGMGRL) enables you to manage a Data Guard broker configuration and its databases directly from the command line, or from batch programs or scripts.

    ````
    <copy>
    dgmgrl
    </copy>
    ````

4. To run **DGMGRL**, you must have **SYSDBA** privileges. Log in as user SYSDG with the SYSDG administrative privilege to perform Data Guard operations. You can use this privilege with either Data Guard Broker or the DGMGRL command-line interface.

    ````
    <copy>
    CONNECT sysdg;
    </copy>
    Password: Use the strong password written down in your notes.
    Connected to "WSDB_fra2qq"
    Connected as SYSDBA.
    ````

5. The SHOW CONFIGURATION command displays a summary and status of the broker configuration.

6. The summary lists all members included in the broker configuration and other information pertaining to the broker configuration itself, including the fast-start failover status and the transport lag and apply lag of all standby databases. Write down in your notes the names of the two databases, Primary and Physical standby, and their role (e.g. `WSDB_fra3hb - Primary`, `WSDB_fra2qq - Physical standby`).

    >**Note** : If you receive an error message `ORA-16525: The Oracle Data Guard broker is not yet available. Configuration details cannot be determined by DGMGRL`, check the status of the WSDB Database on WS-DBStb DB System Details page under Databases list at the bottom. Also make sure Create Data Guard operation has completed on WS-DB DB System Details > Work Requests page. Or wait a couple of miutes, and run again the `SHOW CONFIGURATION` command.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW CONFIGURATION;
    </copy>

    Configuration - WSDB_fra3hb_WSDB_fra2qq

        WSDB_fra2qq - Physical standby database

    Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled

    Configuration Status:
    SUCCESS   (status updated 27 seconds ago)
    ````

7. The SHOW DATABASE command displays information, property values, or initialization parameter values of the specified database and its instances. Adding VERBOSE keyword to the command, it shows properties of the database in addition to the brief summary. This is the Primary database.

    ````
    <copy>

10. View the Primary database information.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW DATABASE 'WSDB_fra2qq';
    </copy>

    Database - WSDB_fra2qq

      Role:               PRIMARY
      Intended State:     TRANSPORT-ON
      Instance(s):
        WSDB

    Database Status:
    SUCCESS
    ````

    >**Note** : At this moment, WS-DBStb DB System hosts the WSDB Primary database, and WS-DB DB System hosts the WSDB Standby database.
    WSDB on WS-DBStb DB System has Database Management services enabled.
    WSDB on WS-DB DB System has Database Management services disabled (No Metrics).
    WSDB on WS-DB DB System has Automatic backup enabled, however automatic backups for that database will not be created until it assumes the primary role.
    WSDB on WS-DBStb DB System has Automatic backup disabled, and you can enable it using **Configure automatic backups** button.

## Task 4: Enable Fast-Start Failover

Fast-start failover allows the broker to automatically fail over to a previously chosen standby database in the event of loss of the primary database. Fast-start failover quickly and reliably fails over the target standby database to the primary database role, without requiring you to perform any manual steps to invoke the failover. Fast-start failover can be used only in a broker configuration and can be configured only through DGMGRL or Enterprise Manager Cloud Control.

1. Use DGMGRL on the WS-DBStb primary DB System node to enable fast-start failover.

    ````
    <copy>
    ENABLE FAST_START FAILOVER;
    </copy>
    Enabled in Potential Data Loss Mode.
    ````

2. Because our Protection Mode is MaxPerformance and LogXptMode database property is ASYNC, Fast-Start Failover is Enabled in Potential Data Loss Mode.

    >**Note** : Enabling fast-start failover in a configuration operating in maximum performance mode provides better overall performance on the primary database because redo data is sent asynchronously to the target standby database. Note that this does not guarantee no data will be lost.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW FAST_START FAILOVER;
    </copy>

    Fast-Start Failover: Enabled in Potential Data Loss Mode

      Protection Mode:    MaxPerformance

      Potential Targets:  "WSDB_fra3hb"
        WSDB_fra3hb valid
      Observer:           (none)
      Shutdown Primary:   TRUE
      Auto-reinstate:     TRUE
      Observer Reconnect: (none)
      Observer Override:  FALSE

    Configurable Failover Conditions
      Health Conditions:

        Corrupted Dictionary           YES
        Inaccessible Logfile            NO
        Stuck Archiver                  NO
        Datafile Write Errors          YES

      Oracle Error Conditions:
        (none)
    ````

3. By default, the fast-start failover target for the Primary database is the Physical standby database.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW DATABASE 'WSDB_fra2qq' FastStartFailoverTarget;
    </copy>
      FastStartFailoverTarget = 'WSDB_fra3hb'
    ````

4. And vice versa.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW DATABASE 'WSDB_fra3hb' FastStartFailoverTarget;
    </copy>
      FastStartFailoverTarget = 'WSDB_fra2qq'
    ````

## Task 5: Change Protection Mode

Oracle Data Guard provides three protection modes: maximum availability, maximum performance, and maximum protection.

Maximum Performance mode provides the highest level of data protection that is possible without affecting the performance of a primary database. This is accomplished by allowing transactions to commit as soon as all redo data generated by those transactions has been written to the online log. Redo data is also written to one or more standby databases, but this is done asynchronously with respect to transaction commitment, so primary database performance is unaffected by the time required to transmit redo data and receive acknowledgment from a standby database.

Maximum Availability mode provides the highest level of data protection that is possible without compromising the availability of a primary database. Under normal operations, transactions do not commit until all redo data needed to recover those transactions has been written to the online redo log AND based on user configuration, one of the following is true:
- redo has been received at the standby, I/O to the standby redo log has been initiated, and acknowledgement sent back to primary;
- redo has been received and written to standby redo log at the standby and acknowledgement sent back to primary.

1. Use the cloud console to change the protection mode. Click **≡**, then **Oracle Base Database** under Oracle Database. Click **WS-DBStb** DB System.

2. On the DB System Details page, click the database name link **WSDB** in the bottom table called Databases. This should have Database Role: Primary under Database information.

3. Click **Data Guard Associations** in the lower left menu. Click **⋮** > **Edit Data Guard Association**.

4. Set Protection mode: **Maximum Availability**. Observe how Transport type is set to **Sync**.

5. Type in Database admin password field the strong password written down in your notes. Click **Edit Data Guard** to save changes.

6. Optionally, use DGMGRL on the WS-DBStb primary DB System node to disable fast-start failover, and change the protection mode.

    >**Note** : The following steps from this task are optional. You may skip these steps and run the next task.

    ````
    <copy>
    DISABLE FAST_START FAILOVER;
    </copy>
    Disabled.
    ````

7. Configure the redo transport service to SYNC on Primary database.

    ````
    <copy>
    EDIT DATABASE 'WSDB_fra2qq' SET PROPERTY LogXptMode='SYNC';
    </copy>
    Property "logxptmode" updated
    ````

8. Configure also the redo transport service to SYNC on Physical standby database.

    ````
    <copy>
    EDIT DATABASE 'WSDB_fra3hb' SET PROPERTY LogXptMode='SYNC';
    </copy>
    Property "logxptmode" updated
    ````

9. Upgrade the broker configuration to the MAXAVAILABILITY protection mode.

    ````
    <copy>
    EDIT CONFIGURATION SET PROTECTION MODE AS MaxAvailability;
    </copy>
    Succeeded.
    ````

10. Display the configuration information. If this command is executed immediately, it will display a warning message. The information was not fully updated, and you need to wait a few seconds to verify the configuration.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW CONFIGURATION;
    </copy>

    Configuration - WSDB_fra3hb_WSDB_fra2qq

      Protection Mode: MaxAvailability

        WSDB_fra3hb - Physical standby database

    Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled

    Configuration Status:
    WARNING   (status updated 54 seconds ago)
    ````

11. After a minute, display again the configuration information. As you can see, the protection mode was updated.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW CONFIGURATION;
    </copy>

    Configuration - WSDB_fra3hb_WSDB_fra2qq

    Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled

    Configuration Status:
    SUCCESS   (status updated 56 seconds ago)
    ````

## Task 6: Stop Redo Apply on Standby

1. It is possible to temporarily stop the Redo Apply on a Physical standby database. To change the state of the standby database to APPLY-OFF, use DGMGRL on the **WS-DBStb** primary DB System node. Execute the EDIT DATABASE command as shown in the following line.

    ````
    <copy>
    EDIT DATABASE 'WSDB_fra3hb' SET STATE='APPLY-OFF';
    </copy>
    Succeeded.
    ````

2. Use SHOW DATABASE command to display information, property values, or initialization parameter values of the Physical standby database. Redo data is still being received when you put the physical standby database in the APPLY-OFF state. But redo data is not applied, and you will notice the increasing values of Apply Lag. Also Average Apply Rate has an unknown value.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW DATABASE 'WSDB_fra3hb';
    </copy>

    Database - WSDB_fra3hb

      Real Time Query:    OFF
      Instance(s):
        WSDB

    Database Status:
    SUCCESS
    ````
3. Use again the EDIT DATABASE command to change the state of the Physical standby database, so it resumes the apply of redo data.

    ````
    <copy>
    EDIT DATABASE 'WSDB_fra3hb' SET STATE='APPLY-ON';
    </copy>
    Succeeded.
    ````

4. Verify the APPLY-ON state and Apply Lag that has to be as low as possible, ideally 0. Check the Average Apply Rate.

    ````
    <copy>
    SHOW DATABASE 'WSDB_fra3hb';
