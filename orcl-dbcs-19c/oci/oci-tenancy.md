# Provision OCI resources

## Introduction

These labs will give you a basic understanding of the Oracle Base Database Service and many of the capabilities around administration and database development. This lab will walk you through creating a new Oracle Base Database Service instance. You will also connect into a Database image using the SSH private key and familiarize yourself with the image layout.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* Create a Virtual Cloud Network
* Provision a Database System
* Connect to DB System Node via SSH
* Verify database connection using SQL*Plus

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    * Provided by the instructor for instructor-led workshops
* Access to a laptop or a desktop with
    * Microsoft Remote Desktop software
    * Putty or OpenSSH, PuttyGen, and web browser

## Task 1: Create a Virtual Cloud Network

    - PDB name: **PDB011**.
    - Password: Use a strong password and write it down in your notes.
    - Select workload type: Transaction Processing (default).
    - Configure database backups: **Enable automatic backups**. Leave default values for backup retention and scheduling.

4. Click **Create DB System**.


## Task 3: DB Node SSH Connection

Please take a moment to watch the video below to learn how to perform the Database Lifecycle Task using the OCI Console, and then afterwards, follow the steps shown.

[Connect On-Premises SQL Dev Tool] (youtube:3bJ3JlpGlPo)

1. Wait for DB System to finish provisioning, and have status Available (refresh page).

2. On the DB System Details page, copy **Host Domain Name** in your notes. In the table below, copy **Database Unique Name** in your notes. Click **Nodes** on the left menu, and copy **Public IP Address** and **Private IP Address** in your notes. E.g.
    - Host Domain Name: pub.llXXXXXvcn.oraclevcn.com
    - Database Unique Name: WSDB_xxxxxx
    - Node Public IP Address: XX.XX.XX.XX
    - Node Private IP Address: 10.0.0.XX

3. Verify SSH connection from a Linux client. Change the permissions on the private key file you saved from DB System. Change `ssh-key-XXXX-XX-XX` with the private key file you saved on your computer. (Linux only)

    ````
    <copy>
    chmod 400 Downloads/ssh-key-XXXX-XX-XX.key
    </copy>
    ````

4. Connect to the DB Node using SSH. In OpenSSH, local port forwarding is configured using the -L option. Use this option to forward any connection to port 5500 on the local machine to port 5500 on your DB Node.  (Linux only)

    ````
    <copy>
    ssh -C -i Downloads/ssh-key-XXXX-XX-XX.key -L 5500:localhost:5500 opc@<DB Node Public IP Address>
    </copy>
    ````

5. Set SSH connection from a Windows client. Use PuttyGen from your computer to convert the private key file you saved on your computer to Putty `.ppk` format. Click on Conversions > Import Key. Open the private key. Click on Save Private Key and Yes to save without a passphrase. Use the same name for the new `.ppk` key file, add only the extension `.ppk`. (Windows only)

6. Connect to DB Node Public IP Address port 22. (Windows only)

    ![Putty session](./images/putty-session.png "")

7. Use the `.ppk` private key you converted with PuttyGen. (Windows only)

    ![Putty auth](./images/putty-auth.png "")

8. Create a SSH tunnel from Source port 5500 to Destination localhost:5500. Click **Add**. (Windows only)

    ![Putty tunnels](./images/putty-tunnels.png "")

9. Go back to Session, give it a name, and save it. When asked if you trust this host, click **Yes**. (Windows only)

    ![Putty security alert](./images/putty-security-alert.png "")


## Task 4: Verify DB connection using SQL*Plus.

Please take a moment to watch the video below to learn how to perform the Database Lifecycle Task using the OCI Console, and then afterwards, follow the steps shown.

[Connect On-Premises SQL Dev Tool] (youtube:3bJ3JlpGlPo)

1. All Oracle software components are installed with **oracle** OS user. Use the substitute user command to start a session as **oracle** user.

    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    </copy>
    ````

2. Try to connect to your DB System database using SQL*Plus.

    ````
    <copy>
    sqlplus sys/<Strong Password>@<Database Unique Name> as sysdba
    </copy>
    ````

3. List pluggable databases.

    ````
    <copy>
    show pdbs
    </copy>
    ````

4. You will see `PDB011` in the list opened in `READ WRITE` mode. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ````
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ````

5. Connect directly to the pluggable database.

    ````
    <copy>
    sqlplus sys/<Strong Password>@db-host:1521/pdb011.<Host Domain Name> as sysdba
    </copy>
    ````

    Or

    ````
    <copy>
    sqlplus sys/<Strong Password>@db-host:1521/pdb011.$(domainname -d) as sysdba
    </copy>
    ````

6. Display the current container name.

    ````
    <copy>
    show con_name
    </copy>
    ````

7. List all users in PDB011.

    ````
    <copy>
    select username from all_users order by 1;
    </copy>
    ````

8. This pluggable database doesn't have Oracle Sample Schemas. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ````
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ````

    You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
