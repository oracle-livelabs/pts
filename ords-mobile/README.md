# Develop Mobile Apps using Oracle REST Data Services

**Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)** is a Java application that enables developers with SQL and database skills to develop REST APIs for the Oracle Database, the Oracle Database 12c JSON Document store, and the Oracle NoSQL Database. Any application developer can use these APIs from any language environment, without installing and maintaining client drivers, in the same way they access other external services using the most widely used API technology: REST. ORDS runs the same on the Oracle Public Cloud as it does on-premise.

## Workshop Requirements

* Access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    * Provided by the instructor for instructor-led workshops
* Access to a laptop or a desktop
* No previous knowledge of Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) is required
* iOS and Android programming language knowledge is required

Our focus is to show how Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) can be leveraged and used out-of-the-box on Oracle Autonomous Database, running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. In this workshop we are not teaching programming skills to develop mobile applications for iOS and Android.
