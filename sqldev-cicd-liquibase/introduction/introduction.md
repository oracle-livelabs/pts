# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of frequently merging new software using a single line of code we call master branch. Continuous Delivery (CD) refers to the release of packaged software, modules, or features in frequent cycles. Likewise, Continuous Deployment (CD) refers to the deployment these software packages/modules/features to a production platform in frequent cycles.

Estimated Time: 4 hours 30 minutes
